# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113690133/223448020-88f93844-6013-44c3-912b-3ff7513e0214.png)

The goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
We will have a complete web application composed by:

1. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
2. A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
3. A database or files that store data (data = objects)
4. An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
  
## First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

## What’s a command interpreter?
It’s exactly the sameas the Shell but limited to a specific use-case.We want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

1. Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
2. Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
3. Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
4. Update attributes of an object
5. Destroy an object
## More Info
## Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: $ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash
